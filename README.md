This repository has useful Snowflake administrative, analytic and data engineering queries you can use to do common tasks or get your SQL written faster and more efficient. You can take any of the aginitypkg files and immediately import them into Aginity Pro and Team.

To get started with using query packages a few pre-requisites:

1. You must have Aginity Pro or Team installed.  Visit our website aginity.com/products to download Aginity Pro for free or evaluate Aginity Team. 
2. You must have access to a Snowflake database and appropriate permissions to the catalog tables.

The folders within this repository represent classes of query packages which may interest you.  

**Administrative Query Packages** - Our DBA or admin queries that allow you to do common functions like produce a list of drop statements for tables that match a name or look at database active sessions.

**Analytic Queries** - When available these are queries that do analytic type analysis or transformations either on sample databases that ship with your platform or on simple data sets that you can see how to do the analytic and then can easily transfer it to your business data tables.

**Data Engineering Queries** - These are SQL queries that do more complex data engineering tasks like pivoting rows into columns or other examples that are regularly used by our data engineering community.
